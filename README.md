# WebServer
The webserver works with web browsers. If you use the basic TCP client program on my github to connect to this webserver make 
sure you are on the same port on both programs.
an example input to the client would be "GET /Test.html"
The sever must start first then run the client


Also I heard people copied my program. please don't copy word for word at least change the html file. you know those are just test files please write your own html test files.
